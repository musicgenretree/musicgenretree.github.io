<h1>Music Genre Evolution Tree</h1>
Work in Progress
<br>
Every genre has only one parent, otherwise the tree would be an unreadable mess. 
<br>
The criteria to decide which genre was chosen as a parent genre was the genre that early recordings of the genre were part of. For example, Thrash Metal emerged as a combination of Speed Metal and Hardcore Punk, but early Thrash Metal wasn't actually Hardcore Punk, it was Speed Metal instead, therefore Thrash Metal has a Speed Metal parent, not Hardcore Punk. The same logic applies to nearly every other genre from the tree. 
<br>
The genres under Experimental are the exception to the rule above, as they pretty much have no definitive parent genre, emerging out of new technologies and musical concepts instead of any specific musical style.
