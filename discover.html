<br>Personal Opinion: don't bother with Rolling Stone, Pitchfork or Fantano. While they all had their peak at their respective times, today they all lack the spirit of discovery they used to have and now they are only bothered by talking about what is already popular to get as many visitors as possible. Follow the alternatives instead, it should be a win-win situation.
